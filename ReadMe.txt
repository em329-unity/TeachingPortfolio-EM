Quarto Rendering Note:
- The rendered homepage now lives at `Pages/index.html`. A small root `index.html` file redirects to `Pages/index.html` so the site remains reachable from the project root.
- Running the included `render.ps1` will render the homepage into `Pages/index.html` and recreate the root redirect `index.html` automatically.
