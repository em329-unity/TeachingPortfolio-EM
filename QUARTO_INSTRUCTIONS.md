Quarto source & render instructions (added 12/14/2025)

Structure:
- `Quarto Files/` : contains all source Quarto files (.qmd)
- `index.html` : homepage (generated by rendering `Quarto Files/index.qmd`)
- `Pages/` : rendered HTML pages for About Me, Teaching Philosophy, Mock Assignment, Mock Syllabus, Mock Lesson Plan, and Resume

How to render (Windows PowerShell):

1) Install Quarto if you don't have it: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/

2) From the project root, run:

   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\render.ps1

   or open PowerShell and run:

   .\render.ps1

This script will check that `quarto` is available and will render the homepage to `index.html` in the project root and all other pages into the `Pages/` folder.

Notes:
- Quarto source files are located in `Quarto Files/`.
- If you prefer to render individual pages manually, use e.g.:

  quarto render "Quarto Files/about-me.qmd" --to html --output "Pages/about-me.html"
