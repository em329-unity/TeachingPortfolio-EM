Quarto source & render instructions (added 12/14/2025)

Structure:
- `Quarto Files/` : contains all source Quarto files (.qmd)
- `index.html` : homepage (generated by rendering `Quarto Files/index.qmd`)
- `Pages/` : rendered HTML pages for About Me, Teaching Philosophy, Mock Assignment, Mock Syllabus, Mock Lesson Plan, and Resume

How to render (Windows PowerShell):

1) Install Quarto if you don't have it: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/

2) From the project root, run:

   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\render.ps1

   or open PowerShell and run:

   .\render.ps1

This script will check that `quarto` is available and will render the homepage to `index.html` in the project root and all other pages into the `Pages/` folder.

Notes:
- Quarto source files are located in `Quarto Files/`.
- If you prefer to render individual pages manually, use e.g.:

  quarto render "Quarto Files/about-me.qmd" --to html --output "Pages/about-me.html"

Deploying to GitHub Pages

1) Create a GitHub repository for this project and push the repository (or use `init-git-commit.ps1` to initialize and commit locally, then add a remote and push).

  Example (PowerShell):

  # initialize, commit
  .\init-git-commit.ps1

  # add remote and push
  git remote add origin git@github.com:your-username/your-repo.git
  git push -u origin main

2) The repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` that will:
  - set up Quarto on the Actions runner
  - run `quarto render` (to generate `_site`)
  - publish `_site` to GitHub Pages using the Pages Actions

3) After pushing, open your repository on GitHub → Settings → Pages and verify that Pages deployment is active and uses GitHub Actions (the workflow will create the site for you). The publishing source will be the artifact uploaded by the workflow (no branch configuration is required).

Troubleshooting tips:
- If Quarto rendering fails in the workflow, inspect the workflow run logs under the Actions tab and fix any missing dependencies or source errors.
- If your site files reference `site_libs` paths, ensure the `_site` built files include the correct relative references (the workflow publishes `_site` directly).

If you'd like, I can:
- Create the GitHub repository for you (you will need to provide an access token), or
- Walk you through connecting this local folder to a new GitHub repo and pushing the code now.
