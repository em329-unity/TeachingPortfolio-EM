    "text": "My hope as an educator is to see students walk away from class eager to challenge the state of current understanding. I would like to see students engage in respectful discourse that continues to create and share knowledge. These teaching objectives rely on two main pillars: Mastery and Humility.\nMastery. This pillar is derived by the concept of Shuhari (守破離) that originates from the Japanese tradition called “The Way of Tea” (Chado - 茶道). A similar tradition can be seen in the traditional making of coffee (Buna - ቡና) in Ethiopia. This concept of mastery emphasizes that the fundamental techniques and knowledge do not change. This is applicable in the realm of engineering because the first principles do not change. While materials, fabrication methods, and technology evolve, the core principles remain the same. Shu - Ha - Ri can be broken into three stages. A stage of learning the fundamentals (Shu), a stage of breaking the tradition (Ha), and finally going beyond (Ri). Teachers serve as a guide during a student’s journey to mastering the principles of engineering, or any other fundamental based discipline. It is of uptmost importance for student to take ownership of their education. These stages of mastery resemble Bloom’s taxonomy if the 6 levels are paired down into 3 groups. Students begin learning with remembering and understanding ideas. Then they move towards applying and analyzing. Finally, they reach a point of evaluating arguements and creating original work. I find the role of mentoring students to be a critical position in shaping generations to be active and competent citizens in the global community. This concept of mastery is presnt in my teaching methods by the emphesis of “See - Do - Teach”. A method introduce to me by Dr. Robert Brown, a senior Lecture of Physics at Duke. Students are asked to first observe and learn the principal concept. Second, practice and apply the principal in different conepts. Third, explain and discuss the concept to their peers. The emphasis of course assignments is less on inducing stress, but encourage growth through proper practice and reflection. Inevietable on the journey to master, consistent practice is important. Instead of using homework assignments as a grading assessment they are a means of providing practice of good form. The optional practice problems provided in homeworks are intended to strengthen their problem solving skills. It will be made clear to students in my class that only honest and professional work will be accepted. The main form of assessment will be in-person tests for my classrooms. In order to assess a student’s ability to recal, apply, and evalue concepts students must prepare themselves for a test. The prepartion involved is an important contributor to their learning and structuring the timeline of preperation. However, it is the teacher who must provide fair and reasonable questions based on reasonable expectations. Additionally, teachers must provide constructive feedback for students. Therefore, a distinction between simple satisfactory and unsatisfactory is inadequate. Less graded assignments allows students to practice good form, and teachers to provide quality feedback. As an instructor of undergraduate or graduate level courses, students will be supported but likewise expected to dedicate the designated amount of time for the course. The instructor must make themselves available and establish a welcoming invitation to assist studets. However, as a university student, the expectation is that they are willing to meet the professor half way and also communicate in a timely fashion.\nHumility: A teachear serves as a guide in a student’s academic development journey, but they must also reflect on themselves. I believe that the key to mastery begins and ends with humility. Teachers must recognize the limitations of their knowledge, their bandwidth of time, and bias while teaching. The teacher has the responsibility of leading a safe and assessible learning environment. The students also have the responsibility of contributing and engaging with this environment. However, a higher expectation is sent on instructors because they serve as a role mode. As a teacher, I aim to provide all resources in an assesible manner so that all students can engage with the material. The in-class learning activities seeks to bring this to the classroom setting. These activities provide an opportunity for students to internally refect and externally discuss with their peers their understandings. Teachers must also reflect and discuss their understanding! Instructors must come prepared by being knowledgeable in the material they are presenting and honest by sharing the limitations of their understanding. The notion of “authority achieved in the classroom is recieved by giving up your authority” was brought up Dr. Quinn Warnick, during a course on Contemporary Pedagogy at Virginia Tech. Teachers who embrace this vulnerability will leave behind arrogance and walk into a classroom respecting and connecting with their students, in a professional manner. In turn, they’ll serve as a role of model someone who values mastery over perfection and in there journey of learning grow to love their profession. These I find to be the most influential teachers. Often, I notice teachers who have the virtue of humility have naturally captivating lectures. They are individuals, who like storytellers, provide proper context, questioning, and genuine interest that makes a lecture both empowering and exciting to attend. I will admit, this only works to an extent as not all material is appealing to the student.\nDuring my time as a graduate teaching assistant, the lines between teaching and learning became blurred. I was able to work in an environment that both strengthened and humbled me. This setting reminds me of one line in the philoshophy of ShuHaRi that continues to resonate with me. “Dedcate to protect, break or detach, but never forget its essence”. To master teaching, we must become experts in our fields, continue to challenge our teaching methodologies, and never forget that at the core we are also students."

    "text": "Background\n Hi, I’m Ezra Melaku and thank you for joining me on this journey through my teaching experiences and philosophies. Before discussing more about my teaching endeavors, here is some background of who I am and where I’m coming from. Originally, I’m from Charlotte, North Carolina. However, home has been many places. In recent years, I’ve spent a majority of my time in North Carolina, Atlanta, Washington D.C, Virginia, and Ethiopia. I began studying engineering after attending the NC School of Science and Math. The rigor of mastering fundamental principles and the sense of empowerment that came from understanding drew me closer to the discipline of engineering. The humility and integrity of civil engineering inspired me to take a step in the direction of structural engineering. As an undergraduate student at Duke University, the underlying pressure to excel academically felt ever present. I became intrigued by effective learning strategies to better manage stress in the context of both physics and life. While working one-on-one with students as a graduate teaching assistant at Virginia Tech, my focus on effective learning grew into a broader interest in pedagogy. Ever since, I’ve worked towards refining my technical skills and my teaching methodology. My lifelong commitment to learning and teaching is a result of mentors and teachers who both challenged and supported me during the early stages of my academic development. I’m truly grateful for their guidance and service. Outside of the sphere of engineering and education, you’ll commonly find me outdoors running or reading.
